## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationships between chronic disease indicators and mortality rates in the United States from 2020 to 2023. The main objectives are:

1. Are there correlations between chronic disease indicators (e.g., diabetes prevalence) and specific death rates (e.g., due to heart disease)?

2. What were the leading causes of death each year between 2020 and 2023?

## Data Sources
The project utilizes the following datasets:
- **Monthly Provisional Counts of Deaths by Select Causes (2020-2023)**: Provisional counts of deaths categorized by various causes, including chronic diseases.
- **U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators**: A comprehensive set of chronic disease prevalence indicators, including diabetes and heart disease rates across states.
